# Digital Systems Project – LLM-Based Carbohydrate Counting

## Overview

This project investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated carbohydrate estimation from food descriptions and/or images.

The objective is to evaluate the feasibility, accuracy, and limitations of LLM-driven nutritional analysis within digital health systems.

---

## Objectives

- Develop an LLM-powered carbohydrate estimation pipeline  
- Evaluate model accuracy against ground-truth nutritional data  
- Compare performance across different food types  
- Analyse system reliability and limitations  

---

## System Architecture

The system consists of:

1. Input layer (text description and/or image input)  
2. Pre-processing pipeline  
3. LLM inference stage  
4. Post-processing and structured nutritional output  

An architecture diagram can be included here if applicable.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.x  
- OpenAI API (or alternative LLM provider)  
- FastAPI / Flask (if applicable)  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Any database or storage solution used
